# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
I and my childhood friend Martha always dreamed about changing the world, so when she got the chance to pitch an investment in cryptocurrencies to her firm **Accountability Accounting**, I jumped at the chance to help out. After all, we both think that changing the world is what crytocurrency is all about. As Martha and I both know, the popularity of Bitcoin has caused a price jump that makes it unaffordable for many new investors. However, there are many more cryptocurrencies available at more affordable prices. Martha has a data set of cryptocurrencies and can analyze it in any way she wants. It's my job to help Martha discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new currencies. Lucky for both of us and for Martha's firm, ths is the perfect job for unsupervised machine learning.
